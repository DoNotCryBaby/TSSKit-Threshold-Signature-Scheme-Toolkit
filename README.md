The research focuses on an autonomous recommendation system for enterprises, developers, and general users to configure the threshold signature scheme that fits their industrial needs. A comprehensive list of options will be served, including but not limited to decisions on private key splitting, multisig detection, HD derivation, signer privacy, signature size. The system considers the arbitrarily specified configurations and tunes these parameters to reach an optimized threshold signature scheme. In addition, some of the codebase and scripts will be generated on-the-fly for developers. The core value of the research is to make the procedure “automated” and “optimized”.
